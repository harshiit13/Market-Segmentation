User : is it fair to date anyone in young age
AI : Krishna (Bhagavad Gita 2.47): 'Karmanye vadhikaraste, ma phaleshu kadachana, ma karma phala hetur bhoor, ma te sango Ã¢ÂÂstv akarmani.' Meaning: Focus on your duty without attaching yourself to the results. Explanation: The Bhagavad Gita emphasizes the importance of duty, ethics, and righteous living. While dating is a personal choice, it should align with values of mutual respect, understanding, and emotional maturity. Relationships formed in youth should be based on genuine connection rather than superficial attraction. Guidance from family, elders, and inner wisdom is essential to navigate relationships wisely and ensure they contribute positively to personal growth and character development.
