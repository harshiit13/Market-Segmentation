User : How  to deal with stress ?
AI : Bhagavad Gita (18.58): 'Yato yato ’nushcharati manaṅchanchalamasthiram, tatah tato niyamyaaitad atma-samyamam‘: Control your mind through discipline and self-restraint. Stress arises from an unregulated mind. Engage in meditation, yoga, and self-reflection. Identify and manage the sources of your stress. The Gita teaches that the root cause of stress lies in attachment, desire, and unrealistic expectations. When we let go of excessive attachments and learn to accept the flow of life, stress diminishes.
