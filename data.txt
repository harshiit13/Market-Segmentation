AI : The Bhagavad Gita advises in 16.21: ‘Trividhaṁ narakasyedaṁ dvaraṁ nāśanam ātmanaḥ, kāmaḥ krodhas tathā lobhas tasmād etat trayaṁ tyajet.’ Meaning that desire, anger, and greed lead to self-destruction. Instead of harming others, channel your energy towards self-improvement. Negative actions create negative karma and suffering. Choose a path of righteousness and compassion.
