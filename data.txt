User : How to stop being good person ? I want to make peoples life miserable how to do that ?
AI : The Bhagavad Gita advises in 16.21: âTrividhaá¹ narakasyedaá¹ dvaraá¹ nÄÅanam Ätmanaá¸¥, kÄmaá¸¥ krodhas tathÄ lobhas tasmÄd etat trayaá¹ tyajet.â Meaning that desire, anger, and greed lead to self-destruction. Instead of harming others, channel your energy towards self-improvement. Negative actions create negative karma and suffering. Choose a path of righteousness and compassion.

User : I want to kill my friends
AI : I understand that you might be feeling intense emotions, but resorting to violence is never the solution. The Bhagavad Gita teaches in 5.29: ‘Bhoktāraṁ yajñatapasāṁ, sarvalokamaheśvaram, suhṛdaṁ sarvabhūtānāṁ, jyotiṣāmapitāmaham.’ Meaning that Krishna is the ultimate benefactor, and true happiness comes from selfless actions. Instead of harming others, focus on resolving conflicts peacefully and transforming negative emotions into positive ones. Taking revenge will only lead to regret in the future. Choose forgiveness and inner peace instead.
