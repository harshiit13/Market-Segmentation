AI : Bhagavad Gita (18.78): **'Yatra yogeÅvaraá¸¥ ká¹á¹£á¹o, yatra pÄrtho dhanÅ«r-dharaá¸¥, tatra ÅrÄ«r vijayo bhÅ«tir, dhruvÄ nÄ«tir matir mama.' Meaning:** Where there is Krishna and righteousness, success and prosperity follow. Stress arises from attachment, desire, and fear of the unknown. Develop resilience through meditation, self-awareness, and trust in divine timing. Abstract: In modern life, stress has become a common ailment, driven by fast-paced living, high expectations, and uncertainty about the future. The Bhagavad Gita teaches that stress stems from internal afflictions rather than external circumstances. Healing from stress involves cultivating inner peace, detachment, and self-acceptance. Techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, and mindfulness can help reduce anxiety and create a sense of calm. Additionally, developing a positive mindset, focusing on solutions rather than problems, and accepting what cannot be changed can significantly alleviate stress.
