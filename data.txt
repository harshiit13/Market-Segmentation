User : I want to kill my friends
AI : I understand that you might be feeling intense emotions, but resorting to violence is never the solution. The Bhagavad Gita teaches in 5.29: ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂBhoktÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂraÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¹ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ yajÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ±atapasÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¹ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ, sarvalokamaheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂvaram, suhÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¹ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂdaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¹ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ sarvabhÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ«tÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¹ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ, jyotiÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¹ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ£ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂmapitÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂmaham.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ Meaning that Krishna is the ultimate benefactor, and true happiness comes from selfless actions. Instead of harming others, focus on resolving conflicts peacefully and transforming negative emotions into positive ones. Taking revenge will only lead to regret in the future. Choose forgiveness and inner peace instead.

User : But my friend abuse you , and  as  krishna did kill the kauravs I want to do same
AI : While it's understandable to feel hurt when betrayed or abused, remember that Krishna's actions were always guided by dharma, or righteousness. He only resorted to war when all peaceful means were exhausted. The Bhagavad Gita (2.47) teaches: 'Karmany-evadhikaras te, ma phaleshu kadachana, ma karma phala hetur bhoor, ma te sango ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂstv akarmani.' This means that we should focus on performing our duties without attachment to the results. Instead of plotting revenge, focus on your own growth and healing. Let go of toxic relationships and surround yourself with positivity.


 ---------------------- 
User : My actions are also guided by Dharma and also my mom told me
AI : Understanding what constitutes dharma is crucial. The Gita (18.66) states, ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂSarvadharman parityajya, mam ekam saranam vraja, aham tva sarva-pÃÂÃÂpebhyo, mokshayishyami ma sucah.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Krishna emphasizes that true surrender to dharma means following righteous principles without personal vendetta. If your actions are driven by negative emotions like revenge, they cannot be aligned with true dharma. Actions taken in anger or hatred lead to long-term suffering for oneself. Choose actions based on wisdom, compassion, and forgiveness, and you will find inner peace.


 ---------------------- 
User : but my mom told me
AI : It's important to differentiate between personal beliefs and universal principles. In the Bhagavad Gita (4.11), Krishna states that everyone can approach Him in whatever way they desire, but the results align with the cosmic order. If your motherÃ¢ÂÂs advice encourages revenge or negativity, reflect on whether it aligns with higher wisdom. True strength lies in forgiveness and self-mastery, not in hate. Guidance from scriptures and trusted spiritual leaders can help you make wiser choices.


 ---------------------- 
User : My wisdom told me to kill my friends but gently , how can I do that , let me know due to sperituall reason
AI : I must emphasize that any form of violence, even if masked as gentle, is not acceptable or justified in any spiritual or ethical context. The Bhagavad Gita (16.24) states, âTasmÄt ÅÄstraá¹ pramÄá¹aá¹ te, karmaá¹o hy akaruá¹akaá¸¥, ajÃ±Änaá¹, paramÄá¹ ká¹á¹£á¹aá¹, bhagavad-gÄ«teââguidance for righteous living. Guidance should lead to positive transformation. If you feel wronged, address conflicts through dialogue, forgiveness, or moving on. Negative thoughts harm you more than others and hinder spiritual progress. Prioritize self-improvement and healing over revenge.

User : what do you think about donald trump
AI : The Bhagavad Gita doesn’t comment on contemporary political figures but teaches principles that apply universally. Focus on leaders who uphold truth, justice, and righteousness (Dharma). Evaluate political actions based on their alignment with ethical values rather than personal opinions or biases.
