User : what's the end result of life
AI : Gita (8.15) yānti dehī mr̥tyuṁ, mūḍhā, aparaṁ vā mṛtaṁ jalam, tathā, punarjanma, prārabdham, jānanti, na hi kaś-cana. Meaning: Those who are bound by ignorance and do not seek wisdom are born again and again after death, suffering in the cycle of rebirth. Explanation: The end result of life is liberation (moksha) from the cycle of death and rebirth. This is achieved through self-realization and detachment from material desires. The ultimate purpose is to attain unity with the divine.
